Hello recruiters 😊

* The languages I use the most are probably Python and JavaScript (plus TypeScript), but I have written decently large amounts of Ruby, Rust, Haskell, C, C++ and C#.
* Web-wise, I have done some fairly complex layouts and designs with HTML/CSS and can am very comfortable with Vue and React.
* I've tended to choose Node to write backend services, but I have started to look at Haskell for HTTP servers (example: [audioscrobbler-mock](https://github.com/linabeee/audioscrobbler-mock)).
* The databases I have personally used are PostgreSQL and SQLite plus a little bit of Redis
* I am fairly confident with Docker at this point but I haven't used (read: managed to get working locally) an orchestration framework (i.e Kubernetes) so far.
* and I know enough Nix to be functionally dangerous
* Naturally I can use Git and GitHub since you're already here
