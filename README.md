Hello recruiters 😊

The languages, frameworks and ecosystems I have the most experience in are:
* JavaScript+TypeScript and web technologies,
* Python,
* C++ including Qt5,
* Rust, Haskell, C# and C.

I can create fairly complex, visually consistent layouts and designs with HTML/CSS, using both traditional classes and stylesheets, Bootstrap, and TailwindCSS, and I am very comfortable with React/Preact and Vue.js.

I use Flask and Express.js for scaffolding backend web services.

The database engines I have written applications for are PostgreSQL and SQLite, plus Redis for both caching and as a fast simple data-store.

I have used Docker to containerise and deploy a number of applications, and I can create development environments and packages with Nix and the nixpkgs ecosystem.

I can work with Git, GitHub and Mercurial.

If you want to talk to me, please send me an email at me@\[the domain in my profile].
